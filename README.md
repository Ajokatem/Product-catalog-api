# Product Catalog API

This is a simple product catalog API built with **Node.js**, **Express**, and **Sequelize** (ORM) that connects to a **MySQL** database. The API allows users to manage categories and products, with basic CRUD operations. It supports product creation, updating, deletion, and retrieval, along with category management.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js** - Server-side JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** - Web framework for Node.js
- **Sequelize** - Promise-based Node.js ORM for MySQL
- **MySQL** - Relational database
- **dotenv** - For managing environment variables

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14 or above)
- **MySQL** (installed and running)


## Setup
